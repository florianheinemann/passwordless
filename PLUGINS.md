### TokenStores
TokenStores are used to store valid tokens for the time of their validity. A couple of implementations already exist, but it is also quick and easy to develop your own TokenStore with the help of the provided test framework.
* [MongoStore](https://github.com/florianheinemann/passwordless-mongostore): Implementation for MongoDB
* [MongoStore (bcrypt-nodejs)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/passwordless-mongostore-bcrypt-node): Same as above but using [bcrypt-nodejs](https://github.com/shaneGirish/bcrypt-nodejs) instead of the native version of bcrypt
* [RedisStore](https://github.com/florianheinemann/passwordless-redisstore): Implementation for Redis
* [RedisStore (bcrypt-nodejs)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passwordless-redisstore-bcryptjs): Same as above but using [bcrypt-nodejs](https://github.com/shaneGirish/bcrypt-nodejs) instead of the native version of bcrypt (Thanks [Lloyd Cotten](https://github.com/lloydcotten))
* [PouchStore](https://github.com/daleharvey/passwordless-pouchstore): Implementation for PouchDB / CouchDB (Thanks [@daleharvey](https://twitter.com/daleharvey))
* [PouchStore (bcrypt.js)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passwordless-pouchstore-bcryptjs) Implementation for PouchDB / CouchDB using Bcrypt.js (much easier to install).
* [BookshelfStore](https://github.com/nnarhinen/passwordless-bookshelfstore): Implementation for Bookshelf.js (Thanks [@nnarhinen](https://twitter.com/nnarhinen))
* [RethinkDBStore](https://github.com/staygrimm/passwordless-rethinkdbstore): Implementation for RethinkDB (Thanks [staygrimm](https://github.com/staygrimm))
* [PostgreStore](https://github.com/Battochon/passwordless-postgrestore): Implementation for PostgreSQL (Thanks [Bruno Marques](http://marques.io))
* [LokiJSStore](https://github.com/florianheinemann/passwordless-lokijsstore): Implementation for LokiJS
* [MemoryStore](https://github.com/lloydcotten/passwordless-memorystore): Memory-based implementation (Thanks [Lloyd Cotten](https://github.com/lloydcotten))
* [MySQLStore](https://github.com/billstron/passwordless-mysql): Implementation for MySQL (Thanks [William Burke](https://twitter.com/billstron))
* [NeDBStore](https://github.com/zevero/passwordless-nedbstore): Implementation for NeDB (Thanks [Zevero](https://github.com/zevero))
* [DynamoStore](https://github.com/jessaustin/passwordless-dynamostore): Implementation for [Amazon Web
Services'](//aws.amazon.com/) [DynamoDB](//aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
* [node-cache](https://github.com/andreafalzetti/passwordless-nodecache): In-memory solution based on [node-cache](https://github.com/tcs-de/nodecache) (Thanks [Andrea Falzetti](http://falzetti.me))
* [node-cache-manager](https://github.com/theogravity/passwordless-cache-manager): Implementation for [node-cache-manager](https://github.com/BryanDonovan/node-cache-manager), supporting multiple storage types (Thanks [Theo Gravity](https://github.com/theogravity))
* [AuthJetStore](https://github.com/authjet/passwordless-authjetstore) Free cloud-hosted solution from the makers of [AuthJet](https://authjet.com) (Thanks [@ecwyne](https://github.com/ecwyne))

In case you need something different, simply fork one of the exiting TokenStores or start from scratch and implement against [passwordless-tokenstore-test](https://github.com/florianheinemann/passwordless-tokenstore-test), a test framework that makes sure you fulfill all the criteria of the API. It might also be worth having a look at the [comments](https://github.com/florianheinemann/passwordless-tokenstore/blob/master/lib/tokenstore.js) of the API.

### Adapters
* [passwordless-hapi](https://github.com/sb8244/passwordless-hapi): A thin adapter to use Passwordless with [Hapi](http://hapijs.com/) (Thanks [@sb8244](https://github.com/sb8244))

### Delivery services
You are free to deliver the tokens in any way that suits your needs. The following modules might be a good starting point:
* [emailjs](http://emailjs.org): Straight-forward node.js email client (requires a SMTP server such as your Gmail account)
* [Mandrill](https://www.mandrill.com): Scalable SMTP infrastructure. They do have a node.js module. In fact, [this website](https://github.com/florianheinemann/www-passwordless-net/blob/master/controller/passwordless.js) uses their services. Free for up to 12k emails per month
* [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/): Similar to Mandrill. Mature node.js module with good documentation
* [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com): Provides APIs for text messages and voice calls. Have a look at the [2-step authentication](/deepdive#2-step-authentication-e-g-for-sms-) to get an idea how to implement it

### Wrapper around delivery services
The following modules ease the use of external delivery services by offering a thin wrapper customized for Passwordless:
* [passwordless-mailgun-delivery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passwordless-mailgun-delivery): A thin wrapper to directly use [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) with Passwordless (Thanks [Alex Jurgensen](https://www.campbowen.ca/donate/))
* [passwordless-plivo-delivery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/passwordless-plivo-delivery): A thin wrapper to directly use [Plivio](https://www.plivo.com/) with Passwordless (Thanks [Alex Jurgensen](https://www.campbowen.ca/donate/))
* [passwordless-sms](https://github.com/authjet/passwordless-sms): Deliver tokens via SMS using [AuthJet](https://authjet.com)
